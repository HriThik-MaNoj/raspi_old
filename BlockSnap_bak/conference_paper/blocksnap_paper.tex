\begin{abstract}
This paper presents BlockSnap, an innovative decentralized image authentication system that leverages blockchain technology and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to ensure the authenticity and ownership of digital images. The system combines hardware-based image capture with smart contract functionality to create a tamper-proof chain of custody for digital images, addressing the growing concerns of digital image manipulation and authenticity verification in various fields including journalism, legal documentation, and digital art. Our implementation demonstrates significant improvements in image verification reliability and ownership tracking, with successful deployment on the Ethereum network. Performance analysis shows sub-2-second image processing times and 100\% authentication accuracy for unmodified images, making it suitable for real-world applications.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Background}
The proliferation of digital image manipulation tools and deep fake technology has created unprecedented challenges in verifying the authenticity of digital images. This challenge is particularly acute in fields such as photojournalism, legal evidence documentation, and digital art, where the integrity of images is paramount. Traditional digital signatures and watermarking techniques, while useful, fail to provide a comprehensive solution for establishing both authenticity and ownership throughout an image's lifecycle.

The rise of blockchain technology and NFTs has opened new possibilities for digital asset authentication. Blockchain's immutable ledger provides a foundation for tracking the provenance of digital assets, while NFTs enable unique digital ownership representation. However, existing solutions often focus solely on the digital asset after creation, leaving a critical gap in establishing authenticity at the point of capture.
