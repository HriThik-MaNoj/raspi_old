# BlockSnap Verification System

## Overview

The BlockSnap verification system has been enhanced to provide robust blockchain-based verification for media authenticity. This document outlines the key improvements and provides instructions for testing the verification functionality.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Blockchain Verification

- **Progressive Block Range Search**: Implemented a fallback mechanism that tries multiple block ranges (1000 blocks, 100 blocks, all blocks) to handle RPC limitations.
- **Transaction Type Detection**: Added function signature analysis to identify different types of transactions (photo, video chunk, video session, contract interaction).
- **Improved Owner Information Retrieval**: Enhanced the owner lookup process to ensure reliable owner information display.

### 2. Distributed Verification System

- **Cross-Node Verification**: Enhanced the distributed verification system to allow any node in the network to verify media captured by any other node.
- **Metadata Preservation**: Ensured all relevant metadata fields are preserved during the verification process.
- **Improved Error Handling**: Added detailed logging and robust error handling for better diagnostics.

### 3. API Enhancements

- **New API Endpoints**: Added `/api/verify/tx/<tx_hash>` and `/api/distributed/verify/tx/<tx_hash>` endpoints for transaction verification.
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained compatibility with legacy endpoints through redirects.
- **Enhanced Response Structure**: Improved the response structure to include all relevant metadata based on media type.

## Testing the Verification System

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Flask server running
- Network connectivity (for distributed verification)

### Test Scripts

The following test scripts are available to verify the functionality of the verification system:

1. **test_distributed_verification.py**: Tests the distributed verification functionality using mocked network requests.

   ```bash
   python test_distributed_verification.py
   ```

2. **test_api_verification.py**: Tests the API endpoints for transaction verification.

   ```bash
   python test_api_verification.py [tx_hash]
   ```

   If no transaction hash is provided, a default test hash will be used.

### Expected Results

- **Successful Verification**: The test scripts should output detailed information about the verified media, including:
  - Media type (photo, video_chunk, video_session, contract_interaction)
  - Owner information
  - Token/chunk/session IDs (depending on media type)
  - CID (Content Identifier)
  - Additional metadata (if available)

- **Unsuccessful Verification**: If the transaction hash is not found or cannot be verified, appropriate error messages will be displayed.

## Troubleshooting

- **RPC Errors**: If you encounter RPC errors, check the block range settings in `blockchain_handler.py`. The system is designed to handle BuildBear RPC limitations by using smaller block ranges.
- **Network Connectivity**: For distributed verification, ensure that the node has network connectivity and can reach other nodes in the network.
- **Logging**: Check the logs for detailed information about the verification process and any errors that may occur.

## Future Enhancements

- **Performance Optimization**: Further optimize the verification process for faster response times.
- **Additional Metadata**: Add support for more metadata fields in the verification response.
- **Enhanced Security**: Implement additional security measures for the verification process.

## Conclusion

The enhanced verification system provides a robust and reliable way to verify media authenticity using blockchain technology. The improvements ensure that all relevant metadata is preserved and displayed, even when dealing with RPC limitations or complex transaction types.
